- Configure settings in Microsoft Entra ID
- **Microsoft Entra ID** → **Protection** → **Conditional Access** → **Policy snapshot** → Find the MFA policy for privileged role accounts:
  - Under **Grant**, set to _"Grant access"_ → Check _"Require multi-factor authentication"_ and _"Require authentication strength"_.
  - Ensure emergency access or break-glass accounts are excluded from this policy.
- **Quick Check**: **Entra ID** → **Conditional Access** → **Authentication strengths** → Verify a policy exists under _"Phishing-resistant MFA"_ (Note: Still double-check CA policies, as some may not appear here).
- **Prerequisite**: **Entra ID** → **Authentication methods** → **Policies** → Confirm phishing-resistant authentication methods are enabled (required for configuration).
